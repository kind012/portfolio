                After graduating from High school, I decided to pursue my
                passion for programming. I enrolled in a college and learned
                coding and software related things to become front-end
                developer. My favorite part of programming is the
                problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring
                out a solution to a problem. My core stack is{" "}

                also have a small passion for design. I am always looking to
                learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time
                position as a{" "}

                When I'm not coding, I like listening to music and I enjoy it,
                watching movies, I also enjoy learning new things.üéπ
